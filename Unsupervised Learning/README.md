# Unsupervised Learning

An __Unsupervised Learning__ algorithm takes in features for which the labels are unknown, and the algorithm is trained to predict the labels. These algorithms can be characterized broadly into four categories: clustering, anomaly detection and novelty detection, visualization and dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.  Some examples of common unsupervised learning algorithms within these categories include Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Eclat. 

This directory contains one module on the K-Means Clustering algorithm.
