# Unsupervised Learning

An __Unsupervised Learning__ algorithm takes in features for which the labels are unknown, and the algorithm is trained to predict the labels. This directory contains one module on the K-Means Clustering algorithm. 

Unsupervised Learning algorithms can be characterized broadly into four categories, indicated by the numbered list below. Some examples of common unsupervised learning algorithms within these categories include:

1. Clustering algorithms
    - K-Means
    - DBSCAN
    - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
2. Anomaly detection and Novelty detection algorithms
    - One-class SVM
    - Isolation Forest
3. Visualization and dimensionality reduction algorithms
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
    - Kernel PCA
    - Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
    - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
4. Association rule learning algorithms 
    - Apriori
    - Eclat
