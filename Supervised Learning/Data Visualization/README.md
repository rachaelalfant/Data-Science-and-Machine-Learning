# Data Visualization

__Data Visualization__ is a crucial part of data science and machine learning because it helps us represent and communicate elements of complex, high-dimensional data sets, usually through plots and diagrams. 

In the following module, __Visualizing & Making Predictions with Financial Data__, we design an algorithm that predicts trends in the close prices of [Stooq Index Data](https://stooq.com/db/). More info on remote data access can be found with the [Pandas Data Reader Documentation](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_data.html#stooq-index-data).
