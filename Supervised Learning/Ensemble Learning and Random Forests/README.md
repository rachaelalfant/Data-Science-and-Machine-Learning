# Ensemble Learning and Random Forests

An __Ensemble Learning Algorithm__, or __Ensemble Method__, refers to the technique of using a group of predictors to obtain better predictions than with any one of the individual predictors. This technique works particularly well if the individual predictors make different types of errors.

In this module, we:

1. Train a voting classifier in Scikit-Learn, composed of the Random Forest, SVC (Support Vector Classification), and MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) Classifiers, and
2. Train a bagging classifier in Scikit-Learn via a Decision Tree Classifier.

We use an artificial dataset from Sklearn's [make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html#sklearn.datasets.make_classification).
