# K-Nearest Neighbors

In this module, we implement a KNN algorithm for classification - to predict the majority label of the k closest points - and show how it can also be implemented for regression - to predict the average label of the k closest points. We train the algorithm on the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html#sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer).
