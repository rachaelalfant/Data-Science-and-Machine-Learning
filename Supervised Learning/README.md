# Supervised Learning

A __Supervised Learning__ algorithm takes in both features and labels as inputs in order to make predictions. There are two types of supervised learning algorithms:

- __Classification__: these algorithms are trained to predict which class of labels a data point belongs to. 
- __Regression__: these algorithms are trained to predict a numerical value for a data point based on its features.

Some supervised learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, can be used for both classification and regression.
