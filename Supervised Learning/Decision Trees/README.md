# Decision Trees, Visualizing Decision Boundaries, and Evaluation

A __Decision Tree__ is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification. Random Forests, which will be explored in another module, are composed of multiple Decision Trees. Decision Trees are particularly useful because they do not require extensive data preparation.

In the following module, we train, visualize, and make predictions with Decision Trees on an artificial dataset taken from Sklearn's [make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html).
